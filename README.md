# Chat App
ChatApp is an application that uses the Firebase SDK to integrate backend and database codes, providing users with a secure authentication system where they can sign up, log in and reset their passwords. After successful registration, users are directed to a shared chat screen where they can communicate with each other in real time using the database support offered by Firebase. Additionally, the app features location sharing when sending messages and allows users to view the shared location on a map through integration with OpenStreetMap. The app also includes a "Talk to AI" screen where users can interact with the AI. This screen allows logged-in users to instantly message with artificial intelligence. The application also provides a profile screen where users can access and view their personal information retrieved from the Firebase database.
